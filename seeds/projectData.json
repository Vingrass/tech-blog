    "description": "From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to the purity of the Blessed Machine.

But I am already saved, for the Machine is immortalâ€¦ Even in death I serve the Omnissiah."

    "description": "The beast of metal endures longer than the flesh of men.

Nor must they neglect the tutelage of the Adeptus Prefects, nor the casting of the proper roboscopes."

    "description": "When uttering the incantation, mark well that the rod is upon and not within the intake. The second incantation should not be uttered until all the fumes have come forth, then the way shall be clear for the sacred words to penetrate unto the heart of the engine. If the mounting be hot say the third rune, if it be cold the fourth rune is more appropriate. For then the wrath of the engine will be aroused..."
